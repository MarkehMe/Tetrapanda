Tetrapanda
==========

Command line music recommendations for human beings.
###Usage
$ recommend.pl artist1...

###Sample output
$ ./recommend.pl Skrillex "Kanye West"
I can't Skrillex has ever made a song better than anything by MC Frontalot.

###How it works
Tetrapanda is an innovative new music recommendation software. It has a simple interface- give it your musical tastes on the command line- anything, an artist, song, genre, whatever. It'll entirely ignore your suggestion and give you something I like better.
